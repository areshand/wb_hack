🚀 PRD: Blockchain AI Assistant — 1-Day Hackathon Demo

🎯 Goal

Build an intelligent AI assistant that translates natural language blockchain questions into real GraphQL queries using:
	•	Advanced LLM-powered natural language understanding
	•	Dynamic GraphQL query generation from blockchain schema
	•	Real-time blockchain data retrieval via multiple APIs (Moralis, The Graph, etc.)
	•	Intelligent query optimization and result formatting
	•	Extensible architecture supporting any blockchain question


⸻

🔍 Use Cases (Dynamic & Extensible)

The system will intelligently handle ANY blockchain-related question by:

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Wallet Analysis**: Balance queries, transaction history, portfolio analysis
- **Token Analytics**: Price data, volume analysis, holder distribution, transfer patterns
- **Contract Intelligence**: Interaction analysis, event logs, function calls, deployment info
- **NFT Insights**: Collection analytics, ownership tracking, marketplace data, rarity analysis
- **DeFi Operations**: Liquidity pool data, yield farming metrics, protocol analytics
- **Cross-chain Analysis**: Multi-chain wallet tracking, bridge transactions, asset flows

**Example Natural Language Inputs (Any Variation Supported):**
- "What's the current balance of 0x3Cc19ad349C4afC532673CfA4a561517Aa7cfB84?"
- "Show me the balance for wallet vitalik.eth"
- "Can you check ethereum.eth balance please?"
- "List transactions for buterin.eth"
- "Transaction history of 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
- "Which addresses interacted with the PEPE token contract recently?"
- "What's the 24-hour transfer volume of token PEPE?"
- "Show me recent activity for 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b"

**Implementation Approach:**
	•	OpenAI GPT-4 powered natural language understanding with fallback pattern matching
	•	ENS name resolution (vitalik.eth, ethereum.eth, buterin.eth)
	•	Flexible address detection (39-42 character Ethereum addresses)
	•	Enhanced API result interpretation with USD estimates and gas fees
	•	Intelligent query classification and entity extraction
